They are interested in exploring the possibility of an out-of-the-box (OOB) functionality that would enable entering multiple products in the search bar at once, using a comma-separated format or another delimiter, and display all the listed products accordingly.",

Now go to Temenos4 from level panel and notice that Temenos3. will get replaced with Temenos4.Now when we Turn off \"Hide Single Top Category\" and refresh the catalog page (you can also go out of catalog and comeback. Now you'll see that Temenos1 is also visible. Click Temenos2, now click Temenos3 from level panel, then click Temenos4. Notice that this time Product Catalog maintains all the patch of categories and you can click on any previous categories to go back. It will be something like this All>Temenos1>Temenos2>Temenos3>Temenos4>Temenos5\n\u00a0\nCustomer Use-case:\nCustomer has a use-case where they want to enable \"Hide Single Top Category\" from Catalog page settings for cleaner look of categories. However when they do this, they don't see guided category path which they can use to navigate from one category to another.Eg: When \u201cHide Single Top Category\u201d is unchecked then the guided path should be All>root category>temenos1>temeno2>... , but when \u201cHide Single Top Category\u201d is checked Only root category should be hidden from navigation and rest all part should be visible.Navigating to the previous sub category when customer is on the leaf category should either be possible from the guided path on top of the page of from the left side of the page.It will save user's click to move back in categories.",
