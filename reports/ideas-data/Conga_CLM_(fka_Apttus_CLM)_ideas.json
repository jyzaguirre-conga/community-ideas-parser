People from US will assume end date is March 4th (mm/dd/yyyy) but people from India will assume it is April 3rd (dd/mm/yyyy). The date format changes globally. That's why we want the format as \"March 4, 2024\" to avoid confusion\n\u00a0\n--> We can only mark a date value against a date field using XAC2.0 only if the date value which is in (MM/DD/YYYY) format. Any other format apart from this is throws error\n\u00a0\n--> Why this limitation?\n\u00a0\n--> Customer's request: Date can be stored internally in the format \"mm/dd/yyyy\" but we are requesting for display format as \"Month dd, yyyy\" when user marks date field as smart field in third party agreement document\n\u00a0\nReferenced JIRA : https://conga.atlassian.net/browse/COREAPPS-11178\nTS Case : 00887530 \n\u00a0\nAs this is currently product limitation, customers are looking forward to consider this as enhancement.",

The proposed feature would accommodate this unique requirement, preventing the loss of crucial information during the review.\nWe have encountered challenges where the lack of section highlighting leads to an incomplete picture for our experts, hindering their ability to assess the full extent of modifications and their ramifications on the chapter as a whole.\n\u00a0\nWe believe that the addition of this feature would be a valuable asset not only to our organization but also to other users of your platform who may face similar challenges.",

One flag/field on the Agreement or we can reuse the \"QTC Profile\" and add a new picklist value - for example Non Standard\nWe expect that when this value is set (we can do it on our own, thru our custom logic)\n1.1. All processes will act as Enterprise case - ASync Activation of Agreements/Orders/Assets\n1.2. We load the BSs in ASync mode - Batch, as we discussed if size 1 is the easiest - it's fine\n2. For the same flag/field we hope we can have a one more option on:\nOrder System Properties => System Properties => Order Item Activate Batch Size\nWhy we need that\nMost of the Agreements (maybe 95%) are with very simple Bundles (few Options) where we can use bigger size for example 10 or 20,\nbut currently we are forced to use 1 - because of the scenarios as the one described above\nAs you expect this since one is making activation of the Agreements quite slower than before but we don't have a choice as we can't dynamically change it per Agreement.\nThis we think is way less complex than the one above as it will just read the setting and apply the Batch Size for the OrderActivateJob\nSo what we expect is 1 new Option:\nOrder System Properties => System Properties => Order Item Activate Batch Size (Existing for Enterprise flag) which we can bump to 10\nOrder System Properties => System Properties => Order Item Activate Batch Size (New one for Non Standard flag) that we will put to 1 as it is now for all our cases",

But, there have been asks from the customer community to support it at the Agreement and Order levels. Product responded to the new request by offering the functionality at the \"cart\" level since all the Propose & Quote / Negotiate & Execute / Manage & Fulfill products have \"cart\" as a common object. This cart functionality is our newer offering.For the strategic customer in the subject, if their Salesreps can access to Agreement, they should be able to access the cart, create just the plan without touching anything else (they can create the agreement flow accordingly), reprice and finalize the cart. The plan is created OOTB.\nUnless we hear a justified business reason (not accessing the cart is not such reason) from the customer, we don't see further value in giving this functionality at the agreement level.Once again, we appreciate your contribution to this space.Thanks & Regards,Praneeth BhaviProduct Manager for Manage & Fulfill."

But if the document is not correct, then it will not find the right metadata within the document and hence this email is sent out. Here if the document is wrong then there is no way to know for which agreement or document this updated document has come, so it is not feasible to add merge field in the email template for this specific case. So we can not do much about it, however customer can add more user friendly text if they want and hence this template is provided.\n\n\nAs the reason customer is requesting the below:\n\nThe user needs to be identified which email failed and which email has the wrong attachment. For example, the User can have 3-4 agreements submitted to the business. If the 3rd agreement attachment was wrong and the user needs to get identified like which agreement's attachment was wrong.",

    "content": "Obligations emerge out of a contract as part of the negotiation process. When two (or more parties) negotiate the various terms and clauses in a contract, what they are really doing is determining the obligations of both parties involved in the contract. Here's a simple but effective and fairly validated idea for an effective obligation management solution, where you start with the usual contract negotiation, arrive at the final set of negotiated clauses at signatures, tag those negotiated clauses as which ones need to be tracked as obligations, categorize the obligations, assign an accountable and responsible owner to the obligations, determine how the obligation should be assessed for compliance (in most cases it would be an assessment survey questionnaire) and lastly determine the number of times in a year you would want to assess the obligatino for compliance. Now the system automatically creates TASKS that send an email notification to the responsible (and accountable) persons as the tasks fall due. The email contains a link to an assessment survey (leveraging Salesforce communities here) which can be filled out by the responsible person and submitted. This submission is captured on the obligation and based on the submitted responses, the accountable person can determine whether the obligation is in compliance, at risk of non compliance or is already in jeopardy.",

    "author": "Joseph Franklin",
    "product": "Conga_CLM_(fka_Apttus_CLM)",
    "content": "After user selects the file and clicks send for signatures and then immediately clicks back, because of lightning latency issue, agreement page does not immediately refresh, and still shows status as pending/ready for signatures with send for signatures button still showing up. Now the user can send for signatures again, select file and go through the process all over resulting in 2 envelopes getting created (I have noticed if the back button is clicked too soon, status of the first envelope remains blank). However, Docusign console shows 2 envelopes with the status 'Waiting for others'. In this scenario, the recipient would receive two emails with separate envelopes and is able to open and sign both. After signatures are completed, batch jobs that run at every 15 min interval in the background look for any signed envelopes and insert the signed document under files, then update the agreement status to fully signed and update the envelope status to Completed. If the recipient had signed both envelopes in this case, we see both signed docs under Files section, but the Agreement/Envelope Status update fails.\n\n\nI think we can put in some logic to prevent creation of multiple envelopes at the same time or almost immediately after first envelope is created.\n\nThis has been a consistent and major issue for Fannie Mae (Case#'s 00105836 & 00115083) even after several user trainings and needs some control to built in to the product.",
