Here, the customer has a use-case where not only admins but the other users would also be doing an Invoice Run and as per their business use-case, the Credit Memos should never be auto-approved and should go through the Approval process. So, there should be a way which can control the visibility of the fields \"Auto Approve Invoice\" and \"Auto Approve Credit Memo\" on the Invoice Run Screen. This will help them hide the auto-approval checkbox and users won't be able to approve the Invoice/Credit Memo directly.",

This field is on the cart so if this is edited, then it'll ask for repricing and this can't be skipped.2 - We may create a serious risk w.r.to collections for other customers. E.g., Say, if a persona like Billing Analyst directly changes the frequency from \"Monthly\" to \"Quarterly\" without an ABO/Order transaction, there's no easy way to track change for the managers hence it'll potentially skip the approvals. In the eyes of the audit, it can also go to an extent where the Billing Analyst might have acted in favor of customer by differing the payment that was supposed to come now, thus creating a SOX issue as well.That said - we are actively thinking about giving control to the admins to determine what billing fields must be included/skipped from pricing. This requires coordination with CPQ as they own the cart.Thanks for the idea,Praneeth Bhavi"

The salesreps can open the cart, create a billing plan, re-price & finalize the cart without touching any other pricing fields. Once this process is established, it will be seamless.What we would appreciate is if the users experience any issues in creating the plan from the agreement cart.
