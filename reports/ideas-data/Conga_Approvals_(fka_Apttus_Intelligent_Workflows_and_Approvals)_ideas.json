    "content": "The /approveRequest API call does not allow designating who is approving a request. This is needed in instances where we have a delegate approver who is notified about an Approval. For instance, if an approval is originally assigned to User A, but User A has a delegate configured in the system, User B, then the Approvals module will notify both User A and User B. We currently enable the approval through a third-party application which makes the /approveRequest API call. However, there is no way to indicate in the API call whether the approval was completed by the assigned User A or delegate User B. We need to add a parameter for actualApprover to the /approveRequest API call\n\u00a0\nAccording to the latest documentation for the Approvals API (link: https://documentation.conga.com/approvals/latest/salesforce/approvals-rest-apis-225250750.html) the following call is created to allow recording an approval:\n\u00a0\nApproving Approval Requests\nPOST /approveRequest\nThis API is used to approve approval requests. This API accepts the ID of the approval request and comments as input parameters.\n\u00a0\nThis documentation gives the following example JSON message body:\n{\n\"requestId\": \"a1WJ0000003ACuKMAW\",\n\"comments\": \"test comments\"\n}\n\u00a0\nWe propose adding the following new, optional \"actualApprover\" parameter:\n{\n\"requestId\": \"a1WJ0000003ACuKMAW\",\n\"comments\": \"test comments\"\n\"actualApprover\": \"0051300000B4uxLAAR\"\n}\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease consider supporting this need.",

This occurs due to a Salesforce limitation. When an approver responds via email, the system uses the context user's permissions to approve the request. Therefore, even if the approver lacks permission for the approval request, they can still approve it via email. We request an enhancement where the approver's permissions are checked instead of the context user's permissions when approving a request via email. This would ensure that only those with permission for the approval request object can approve the request. We request that this idea be considered for future product enhancement if possible.\n\u00a0\nRegards,\nConga Technical Support",

We see the incorrect values displayed in the screenshot (where it shows AND). This makes it harder to manage the rules themselves.\n\n\u00a0\nWe do imply that capitalization is needed from the documentation (https://documentation.conga.com/approvals/september-22/salesforce/creating-expressions-143900125.html#id-.CreatingExpressionsvWinter20-Tosetadvancedoptions). However this can be fixed by a stringToUpper call when saving the values, or by not coding for case sensitivity to begin with.",

Can this be converted to a customizable email template? 2. When the async API is submitted, it only returns a Boolean flag. There are series of jobs that execute as part of this API. If any one job fails in between, we do not have trace of the job ID and at which stage it failed. This makes it difficult to do error handling as the submitter has to wait for failure email only. Can the API store Job Ids for different jobs in some object that can be used for error handling by customers? 3. EmailBatchJob: Last job during async approvals processing is sending an email to the approvers. This is an apex batch job as per the current design. Since batch jobs count towards flex queue limit, there are chances of this job not executing during month end, quarter end or year end when volume is high. Can this job also be converted to queueable?",

However, Salesforce would like to scale further and evaluated Conga Async Approvals.\n\n\nAs-Is: Conga provides async approvals via below two approaches:\n\n1. Custom Setting: Process Preview/Submit Asynchronously\n\nPros:\n\n- Customers can retain the existing OOB UI for preview and Submit with comments\n\n- No need to write any custom code to use async approvals\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Every approval in the org will go for async processing. This will increase the overall number of jobs in the queue. And for smaller quotes, async processing may also take more time than sync processing.\n\n\n2. Async API: Apttus_Approval.ApprovalsWebService.SubmitForApprovalsAsync(sObjectType, sObjectId)\n\nPros:\n\n- Customers will have flexibility to decide at run time (based on defined threshold) whether the approvals need to go to async process or not. This will involve custom code\n\nCons:\n\n- No Preview and Submit with Comments available\n\n- Custom code is required to consume the API\n\n\nAsk:\n\n1. Enabling async approvals by just having a switch at runtime is the most easiest and scalable solution that we are looking for. Instead of having custom setting at org level, can we have this type of parameter passed during runtime? We would like to retain our Preview and Submit with Comments UI.\n2.
