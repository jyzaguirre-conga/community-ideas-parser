In practice, this use case is barely supported with current product functionality.\nParticularly if the legacy contract repo contains metadata associated with the contracts, it is a very difficult, error-prone, time-consuming process to get this done.\nIssues and difficulties:\nCCI only supports uploading 100 documents at a timeCCI doesn't support uploading a document while also including metadata from a third party source to map to fields on the created Contract Agreement recordBecause of #2, users are required to manually enter an external doc ID during review so that we can find and dataload external metadata once the CCI review process is complete. Does this work? Yes. Is it reliable, scalable, and easy to use for end users? Absolutely notCCI does not allow users other than the one who uploaded it to review a document, making it hard to gang tackle a migration project. Exception: this is possible if the extraction template is configured as Level 2 and additional users are added as approvers. However, users must now both review and then approve the same data. It is redundant, time-consuming, and a frustrating UXAgain because of #2, admins must follow behind the review process by end users and dataload all the created CA records with their external metadata\nUser Stories\nAs an admin managing the migration of contracts into CFS + SF using CCI, I need a way for CCI to consume documents using automated extraction while also sending external metadata into mapped fields on the CA recordAs an end user reviewing documents during migration, I need a way to allow a team of reviewers to see the documents I upload without having to both review + approve the same document in a redundant fashion\n\u00a0\nI'm sure there is more we can talk about here but this is all I can think of for now haha.

    "content": "CCI -> CFS Instance\nWhen completing the review of a document uploaded in CCI, there are no error handling controls in CCI to help users with ensuring that the data to be synced to Salesforce matches the mapped fields' datatypes.\nEx: The CCI Notice Date provision is mapped to a Date type field in SF. Depending on the contract, CCI might pull out something like \"90 days before the termination of this contract\", which is a text value and not a date value. Currently, unless the user fixes the CCI extraction to be an actual Date, when they complete the review on the document:\nthe sync will failthe document status will go to \"Error - Error in Review\"the user will see an unhelpful message about the data type not being valid (Note: it is helpful for admins, but end users will not understand it at all)the document must be re-submitted and the entire review process starts from scrach\nThis is a very poor UX for end users who know nothing about Salesforce architecture and can't be expected to know and match every data type on their mapped provisions during CCI review. The worst part of it is that there is no way to resolve the errors and the user must start over. This frankly makes the product borderline unusable and must be rectified ASAP. Note that the solution of only mapping CCI provisions to text fields will more or less ensure this issue doesn't happen, but it also ruins reporting capabilities by not using native SF field data types as designed\n\u00a0\nUser Story:\nAs an end user reviewing documents uploaded into CCI, I should not have to know the data types of the fields that my provisions are being mapped into.
