This is preventing our users from selecting a contact to send the Conga document to. The support agent handling this case let us know that this is just how the form works and it's a data issue. \nWe have some duplicate to clean up, but why would this form hide both of the contacts and not just one of them. This is causing our users to go off-system to email documents to contacts, when they could very easily send from within the system.\n\u00a0\nI'm not sure why the search would not match the search results that are returned in a generic SF search, can we alter this search to display all contacts? There should not be a automatic filter in place that hides contacts.\nIf there is no desire to change this, then at least provide a tool tip icon that explains the filters that are in place today. We were not expecting any filtering on this email form and it's causing end-user confusion when they cannot find their contacts in this search.\n\u00a0\nCan the filter be removed?",

If it's not a match, then the system should allow for creation of a contact at this step.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the email field, if users do not fully type out the user's email slowly and type too fast it may prevent the dropdown list from appearing.\u00a0If not selected from the dropdown list, the System will automatically create whoever you put into this field, which accidentally creates duplicates.\u00a0When in doubt- select from the dropdown list.",

Currently all of that is reconfigured manually on each envelope when sending through Conga Sign via the Conga Contracts API. For visibility settings, our organization uses a cover sheet that I would like to be able to make visible to internal parties only.

(2) Also, the use of \"Business Days\" is problematic for the following reasons: what exactly is a Business Day \u2014 US Federal Holidays excluded (why US and not Canada, Mexico, or some other country), State holidays excluded (which State), weekends excluded, does a business day start at 9am and en at 5pm and what time zone, what happens when a contract is submitted in Conga at 5:01pm on Friday and all work flow steps are completed and agreement executed at 5:03pm on Friday - if we are going by Business Day then how is that reported in the duration report?\n\n\nHOW DO YOU FEEL THE REQUESTED FUNCTIONALITY WILL ALLOW YOU TO RESOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\n\nDuration reports should automatically be reported in Conga as a numeric value only that can be filtered by Excel so that true metric reports on how long a particular \"Flow Step\" took can be reported. Also, there are way too many variables with \"Business Days\" as a time period - get rid of business days and just use a 24 hour period.\n\n\nCall me to discuss if I was unclear or if further information is needed. From my position, this is not really an \"enhancement\" but correcting an error in that is preventing true and useful metric duration reports from being created.\n\n\nRevance Therapeutics, Inc\n\nPaco Armijo\n\nparmijo@revance.com\n\n510-588-7062",

If no response, policy is to terminate the agreement. Hundreds of expiring notices are sent monthly by two people. If receipients have left the company, it is critical that we know the Message wasn't delivered.\n\nWith thousands of contracts and hundreds of people handling contracts, this is a major obstacle.",

The excel reports extracts do not auto fit the column widths to the data and the width changes in the report creation, do not adjust the excel column widths and are also very limited.

It seems odd that you can allow Agreement Link field to be on the request form as a field, but then not the related functionality of the tickbox.\n\nThe ability for me as an admin to simply add the 'Missing Parent' tickbox to the request forms would mean that all requestors could then use it to express when the parent is not actually in the system. The current workaround is that once it reaches our Legal Contract Managers in the workflow (who have Full Access) they have to edit the contract profile and need to have heard from the Contract Owner (requestor) what they should update regarding the parent contract. Our Contract Owners are casual users are do not have edit permissions on contract profiles \u2013 otherwise after submitting the request they could be changing critical fields without Legal team's knowledge.",

Currently when a contract is reassigned from one company to another the responsibilities are kept as they are, in particular an assignment to a company person is now assigned to a person at a company that is no longer a party to the contract and who is therefore ineligible to be reselected as fulfilling that responsibility.\n\nThis issue could be resolved in multiple ways, either by removing responsible persons from the contract who are not eligible after reassignment or by moving those persons to the new company. However, both of those options present problems - in the first case, the contract cannot be resaved in the case of required responsibilities now being unfilled, and in the second case it may not be correct that the person has moved to the new company along with the contract. Both of these options also are a breaking change in the application.",

The UI is not too intuitive and I am sure our UX/design experts can improvise this and do better.\n\n\nFor any of our CLM or CPQ implementation, we have full visibility into how much time is spent at each step i.e. to create a agreement/quote, time spent on cart in configuration of products, document generation, approvals, esign, order placement etc.\n\n\nUsing these data points we should be able to generate a visual summary of end to end process along with link to artifacts.\n\n\nValue add: Deal Desk / Legal team can compare two timelines and evaluate where the most time is being spent/delayed.",
