The intention of this calculation is to help configuration management leaders and administrators understand how complex the offering is and its impact on the configuration experience for the sales representatives. For example, the expectation is that offerings with their complexity score marked \u201cComplex\u201d shall have lower performance (higher load times for the configurator) while those marked \u201cLow\u201d shall have comparatively better performance (lower load times for the configurator).\n\u00a0\nConga has shared various parameters involved in loading of the bundle on configuration page. However, GEHC has not been able to relate the computed complexity score and the configurator load times/ performance. They have seen offerings with Complexity score \u201cLow\u201d have as much or sometimes even longer load times than offerings that have been marked complex.\n\u00a0\nThis makes it difficult to understand how to define the complexity of our offerings and the potential impact to the sales users. This is also preventing us from defining a framework for identifying and measuring offering complexity. This information is critical to determine how the platform can guide our administrators to optimize the offerings.\n\u00a0\nPlease refer the attached pdf document on the parameters used and the detailed analysis done by GE so far.",

    "content": "Use case : When user does copy operation in the shopping cart, Externally configured (through third party configurators) items needs to be copied into configurator. For that, configurator provided Silent copy API. This API will create copy of the line-item inside the configurator and run validation to update latest configuration and pricing and then saves all the data back to SFDC Line item & related child object using REST API exposed on SFDC side.\n\u00a0\nCurrent Solution: \nWe are using OOB Copy action button inside shopping cart.We are using OOB beforeCopyBundleLineItems method of Action callback class to populate two custom fields (Is copied from & Copy Is In Progress)OOB copy operation will create new line item and will copy all the fields from previous/copied from Line item to new line item.Turbo Pricing will get execute for new line item.In TP callback\u2019s onPriceItemSet method we invoke third party configurator API (silentCopy) to get the item copied into configurator.Configurator will create the item and validate the configuration & pricing \u00a0and at last will save back all the data on SFDC via REST API exposed on SFDC.Configurator will send back the response to TP callback silentCopy API call.Pricing will continue and post completion, Line item data saved back to shopping cart as part of OOB Turbo sync.\n\u00a0\nProblems in current architecture :\nConfigurator updates back the Line-item data on SFDC while price call is in progress on the Turbo side.Now SFDC line-item has updated data(price fields) but turbo still has old line-item data, so we will be ending up with incorrect prices and configuration in the shopping cart. Moreover, Turbo sync will overwrite the Line item data and possibility of loosing data saved back by the configurator.Reason behind using TP callback to invoke silentCopy API was the absence of any pre-price hook or unavailability of afterCopy function on SFDC side. Also, we can\u2019t use Line item trigger since external callout from trigger will not be supported.Sometimes configurators takes more than 30 seconds to respond back since copy/validation is complex operation so we might face Turbo time out issues. Though we can mitigate this issue by increasing Turbo time out value.\n\u00a0\nCurrent Architecture Diagram",

But Hitachi Energy is one of the early adopter for platform and is enquiring that at least in platform it should be possible to have an 'assign to me' sort of button that we have in many other applications (jira for example). Basically expectation is to have easier way to re-assign the record owner.\n\u00a0\nUse Case: In the functionality for collaboration, this is needed often. Because process wise the collaboration request is assigned to a queue first. Then someone from the queue who wants to work on it will assign the ownership to himself. Hence the ability to assign the collaboration request ownership to oneself is needed.",

    "content": "In a nutshell, the issue is that we are looking send the value of a custom field on the line item to the turbo, but that is currently not happening unless we use the presto app id in the cart url. Can you please help in creating a product jira for the same?\nMore information below. This is for Hitachi Energy.\n\u00a0\nFor the TS ticket (00864899), the issue was that a custom field APTS_ABB_Source_Location__c was not getting passed to turbo when we add a product to the cart.\n\u00a0\nWe got the resolution that we should have this parameter i.e. prestoAppId in the cart URL. When we have this parameter i.e. prestoAppId in URL, then the system makes a call for callPrestoForCart action and subsequently the system calls getCartLineItems. In getCartLineItems, we get updated value in APTS_ABB_Source_Location__c, hence that value is getting passed in Web Socket calls successfully.\n\u00a0\nWhen we do not pass prestoAppId in the cart url, the system doesn't call callPrestoForCart and getCartLineItems explicitly, hence when we land on cart, the system doesn't get an updated value in APTS_ABB_Source_Location__c. This causes the aforementioned issue, as we are currently not passing the prestoAppId in the cart url.\n\u00a0\nFrom a UAT unblocking perspective this resolution sounds good, but our recommendation is that the above solution is only a temporary workaround. Because the presto app id is supposed to be passed on only for cost related calculations, hence it should not be needed to be passed on the cart when we are not doing any pricing calls.\n\u00a0\nThis requires a product fix such that it should be possible to send the value of a custom field on the line item to the turbo without using the presto app id in the cart url.

Even worse is when they click on Configure again, this starts another Cart tab - so now you have two Cart tabs and it's easy to remember which is the active one.\n* Submit for Approval - when submitting for approval, similar to finalize, several tabs open up.

This is frustrating for users who don't remember to close the tab\n* Any Custom VF page opened through a Cart Action, when it redirects back to the Cart, this will result in a separate tab being opened for the Cart.
