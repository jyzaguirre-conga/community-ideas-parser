    "content": "Hi team,\n\u00a0\nAs per the OOTB behaviour, when the \"Auto Cascade\" is TRUE on the PLI, the Bundle Quantity will be cascaded to the Option Line for the New Sales. However, the same use-case doesn't work for the ABO Operations when \"isAssetPricing\" is set to TRUE globally. To make this work, we first need to mark the isAssetPricing Flag to False through some other way and then the Quantity will be cascaded. However, as per the customer's expectations, since the field \"Quantity\" is already present in the custom setting \"Config Asset Line Item Criteria Fields\", the change in the Quantity at the Bundle level should make the isAssetPricing to FALSE for all the options and subsequently the quantity should be cascaded as well to all the Options.This is for the customer ABBYY.",

    "content": "The customer user case is as given below: 1. They are NOT using our Service CPQ module. 2. The Price List Item of the products which are configured on the Cart are NOT having Related Pricing. 3. They have their own custom flow or use case. For that, they are using our RelatedLineItem Object. 4. The user is configuring one of the Product which they are saying as Hardware or Software Product. 5. Along with the Hardware/Software Product, they are adding Coverage Product on the same Cart. 6. The Hardware, Software & Coverage are the custom types of the Product. 7. So here, the customer wants to create a Relationship between Hardware/Software Products and Coverage Products. 8. To achieve that, they are using our OOTB RelatedLineItem object. The user is creating Hardware/Software LineItem along with Coverage LineItem. RelatedLineItem object is working as a junction object between these 2 LineItems. So, they are putting LineItem as Hardware/Software LineItem Id and RelatedLineItem as Coverage LineItem Id. Along with that, they are putting a Dummy Asset on the RelatedAssetLineItem Id. Because without RelatedAssetLineItem Id, the system will throw NullPointerException. 9. The RelatedAssetLineItem field will have the actual AssetLineItem Id only when they are doing renewals. We explained that the OOTB system will never populate the RelatedLineItem lookup field with another LineItem in case of Service CPQ. But the customer is using this customization since more than a year and they don't want to change anything. The implementation was done by the Partner. As per him, the system can copy everything correctly from RelatedLineItem to ProposalRelatedLineItem to OrderRelatedLineItem or RelatedAssetLineItem. The system is also able to clone the correct data (on new configuration) if we configure the already Finalized Quote. Hence, the issue is only on the Deep Cloning of the Quote using Apttus_QPConfig__ProposalClone VF page. So as per the customer's request, we wanted to know whether this can be fixed from our end or not? They are also OK if we can provide this as an Enhancement or Story. FYI: JIRA: CPQ-50745",

The \"OR\" logic is required for to search multiple assets names simultaneously and also to enhance the scope of search criteria.\n2. User should be able to search large number of assets by providing multiple comma separated asset names.\n\nThis is a critical use case for LATAM, EU & JAPAN as they quote with 200+ assets in one configuration.",

The text entered in this filter is matched only with product field, not with any other field.\n\nExpected behavior : Basically this field should work with all the columns present in the list. Asking user to go for advanced filter for even quick search is time consuming and not efficient.\n\n\nRecording:\n\nhttps://conga.zoom.us/rec/share/9PXy-mDWt3tWLocPSFDaBRcwB5s2oN-dmhu_JsHXRdzsSH1Nbdi9A6cY6Dlq9_4W.yPg9G1FGc3YHxgL4\n\nPasscode: Zwu4!@5Z",

    "content": "Business Case: 2 hospitals take help from an organization (can be another hospital as well with its own assets or it can be a non-hospital entity like a Trust or Financer) to negotiate their service contract with GE. The organization will then negotiate with GE for the assets belonging to the 2 hospitals. All the 3 entities (2 hospitals + organization) are \"Accounts\" in GE's salesforce org. The organization and 2 hospitals are independent accounts and are not tied together by any hierarchy. In order to meet such a request, the salesperson needs to create a quote on organization account and fetch the assets of the 2 hospital accounts on the quote. As per current design, this is not possible. Currently, on the installed products page, we can fetch the assets of the account on which the quote is created or any account which is part of the quote account's account hierarchy. As part of this new feature, we should be able to fetch any asset for the accounts belonging to the same country and sell service on these assets. So, the assets on the installed product page should not be limited to the quote account hierarchy. Example: Salesperson from France should be able to quote service on assets belonging to any French account.",
