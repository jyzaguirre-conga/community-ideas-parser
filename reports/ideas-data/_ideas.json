    "author": "Jackie Tsang",
    "product": "",
    "content": "Today, the Conga grid uses pagination to display pages of records, and the Salesforce Datatable component uses lazy loading to show infinite records. The new idea is to provide both options to users, where the admin can set up a default page-loading preference, and end-users would be able to switch preferences based on their needs. For example, we allow them to toggle off lazy loading on the UI so that the pagination component will appear.",

Another idea would be to have anEsignature plugin (https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.cpq_dev_api.meta/cpq_dev_api/cpq_esp_plugin.htm) that works with CPQ.\n\n\nIn the meantime, we may be forced to explore other solutions like docusign, who might offerthis type of plugin (https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.cpq_prepare_for_docusign.htm&type=5) .",
