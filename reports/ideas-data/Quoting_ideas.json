If we have more fields then user has to scroll down. For Hitachi Energy we will have more fields on this tab, and hence want to be able to display all the fields in single view without having to scroll.Ability to provide a URL to open an external page. Currently on the 'completed configuration' tab, there is a link called 'more details' which opens a read only child cart configuration. We want a similar hyperlink to be created on the assignment details tab that will take the user to the collaboration header object. But when we add a field containing the url, it is getting displayed as a text, not as a hyperlink.The collaboration breadcrumb statuses that are displayed on the top of the dialog box - Is it possible to be able to update the labels of the various stages ? Hitachi Energy wants to have the collaboration status tied to quote/proposal stages (draft, submitted, approved etc). We were able to update the collaboration status picklist labels in the field Apttus_Config2__Status__c. But these labels are not getting reflected on the collaboration dialog box.

These fields can have blank value OR incorrect field reference where application is expecting a valid field reference.\n\n\nTroubleshoot challenges:\n\nDue to lack of comprehensive error reporting, the option mostly remain is trial and error, which is always time consuming and painful. Also the customers and partners are then dependent on TS to get the subscriber logs, but that too does not provide such detail Errors.\n\n\nError reporting Required:\n\n1) Enhance the maintenance console to report on such bad configuration data (if required field is blank or referring to non-existed field. So the admin can look for such data at one place and handle clean-up proactively\n\n2) Enhance the Error reporting on transaction time by providing the rule reference which is causing the issue so that diagnosis and fix can happen fast.\n\n\n| Object | Field | Comments |  |\n| Apttus_Config2_ProductAttributeRule_c (Product Attribute Rule)  | APTTUS_CONFIG2_CONDITIONCRITERIAEXPRESSION_C (Condition Criteria Expression) | Look for Apttus_Config2_AttributeValueId_r. | SELECT Id, Name, APTS_Ext_ID__c, Apttus_Config2__ConditionCriteriaExpression__c FROM Apttus_Config2__ProductAttributeRule__c |\n| Apttus_Config2_ProductAttributeRuleAction_c (Product Attribute Rule Action) | APTTUS_CONFIG2_FIELD_C (Target Attribute) |  | SELECT Id, Name, Apttus_Config2__Field__c, APTS_Ext_ID__c FROM Apttus_Config2__ProductAttributeRuleAction__c |\n| Constraint Rule Action (Apttus_Config2_ConstraintRuleAction_c) | APTTUS_CONFIG2_ACTIONCRITERIA_C (Condition Criteria) | Look for Apttus_Config2_AttributeValueId_r. | SELECT Id, Name, Apttus_Config2__ActionCriteria__c, APTS_Ext_ID__c FROM Apttus_Config2__ConstraintRuleAction__c |\n| Constraint Rule Condition (Apttus_Config2_ConstraintRuleCondition_c) | Apttus_Config2_ConditionCriteria_c (Condition Criteria) | Look for Apttus_Config2_AttributeValueId_r. | SELECT Id, Name, APTS_Ext_ID__c, Apttus_Config2__ConditionCriteria__c FROM Apttus_Config2__ConstraintRuleCondition__c |\n| Price List Item (Apttus_Config2_PriceListItem_c) | Apttus_Config2_Criteria_c (Charge Type Criteria) | Look for Apttus_Config2_AttributeValueId_r. | SELECT Id, Name, APTS_Ext_ID__c, Apttus_Config2__Criteria__c FROM Apttus_Config2__PriceListItem__c where Apttus_Config2__HasCriteria__c = true |\n| Price Dimensions (Apttus_Config2_PriceDimension_c) | Apttus_Config2_Datasource_c (Field) |  | SELECT Id, Name, APTS_Ext_ID__c, Apttus_Config2__AttributeId__c, Apttus_Config2__BusinessObject__c, Apttus_Config2__Type__c, Apttus_Config2__Datasource__c, Apttus_Config2__ContextType__c FROM Apttus_Config2__PriceDimension__c where Apttus_Config2__BusinessObject__c = 'Apttus_Config2__ProductAttributeValue__c'\n\n |\n| Price Matrix Entry (Apttus_Config2_PriceMatrixEntry_c) | Apttus_Config2_Condition_c (Condition) | Look for Apttus_Config2_AttributeValueId_r. | select Id, Apttus_Config2__Condition__c, APTS_Ext_ID__cfrom Apttus_Config2__PriceMatrixEntry__c |\n| Price Ruleset (Apttus_Config2_PriceRuleset_c) | APTTUS_CONFIG2_CRITERIA_C (Ruleset Criteria) | Look for Apttus_Config2_AttributeValueId_r. | SELECT Id, Name, APTS_Ext_ID__c,APTTUS_CONFIG2__CRITERIA__C FROM Apttus_Config2__PriceRuleset__c |\n| Price Rule Entry (Apttus_Config2_PriceRuleEntry_c) | APTTUS_CONFIG2_CONDITION_C (Condition) | Look for Apttus_Config2_AttributeValueId_r. |\n\nSELECT Id, Name, APTS_Ext_ID__c, Apttus_Config2__Condition__c FROM Apttus_Config2__PriceRuleEntry__c |\n| Product Attribute (Apttus_Config2_ProductAttribute_c) | Apttus_Config2_Field_c (Field) |  | SELECT Id, Name, Apttus_Config2__Field__c, APTS_Ext_ID__c FROM Apttus_Config2__ProductAttribute__c |\n| Approval Rule\n(Apttus_Approval_ApprovalRule_c) | Apttus_Approval_CriteriaFieldNames_c | Currently no entries that refer to PAV so can be skipped.  |\n\nSELECT Id, Apttus_Approval__Active__c, Apttus_Approval__CriteriaFieldNames__c, APTS_Ext_ID__c FROM Apttus_Approval__ApprovalRule__c |\n| Approval Rule Entry (Apttus_Approval_ApprovalRuleEntry_c)\n\n\n\n | Apttus_Approval_ConditionFieldNames_c\nApttus_Approval_CriteriaFieldNames_c | Look for Apttus_Config2_AttributeValueId_r. |\n |",
