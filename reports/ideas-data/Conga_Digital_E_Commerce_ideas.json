(Image 3 and 4)Hence, there is no way for the user to go back to unfiltered product list so as to see all the products from the catalog.Hence, can we please get an enhancement for\u00a0\n\tPreserving the search text after enter is pressedBringing back user to entire product catalog (unfiltered product list), on clearing the search text.",
