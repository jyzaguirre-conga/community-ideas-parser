But not very ideal. Imagine I am already at 75% zoom on the browser, on a compact laptop like the Lenovo X series. Then when I zoom in to see the steps, the buttons aren't visible. Now, as you mentioned, if I use the CTRL + scroll to zoom out, I see the buttons, but they would be so small that I would need a \"hand lens\" to identify the \"zoom Out\" or \"Reset Zoom\" buttons\u00a0\ud83d\ude0a\nSince, this seems to be a standard product feature, please cascade this feedback to the concerned team, when you have an opportunity.\n>> On the option of going to the print view, via the \"print button\". Yes, this is better, we can zoom in, but again, if the process is big enough, then to scroll the screen from right to left, we have the use the mouse pad on the laptop, not possible to drag using the mouse.
