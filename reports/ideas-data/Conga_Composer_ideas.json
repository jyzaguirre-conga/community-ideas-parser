For instance, if I have document A in Template 1, 2, and 3, and I need to make an update to document A, I'm now required to update Template 1, 2, and 3 individually, rather than updating a single document that would automatically reflect changes across all templates.\n\u00a0\nThank you,\nManny Griego",

We are exploring the possibility of using Conga for this purpose due to our existing integration with Salesforce, but we are open to alternative solutions that can seamlessly integrate with our current Salesforce configuration.\n\u00a0\nProblem Statement:\nCurrently, we send automated vendor performance emails to our customers on a monthly basis via email and Salesforce cases.

This same data is also available to customers through our Experience Cloud-based customer portal.\nHowever, we would like to enhance the customer experience by automatically attaching a concise one-page PDF report to these monthly emails. This PDF report should be generated dynamically based on the vendor's performance for each specific account, including charts, graphs, and visuals for better data representation.\n\u00a0\nBenefits\nKey Requirements:\nAutomated PDF Generation: The solution should automatically generate a one-page PDF report on a monthly basis.\n\u00a0\nDynamic Data: The PDF content should be populated with data specific to the vendor's performance for the respective customer account.\n\u00a0\nVisual Representation: The PDF should include charts, graphs, and other visuals to provide a clear and concise overview of vendor performance.\n\u00a0\nSeamless Integration: The solution should seamlessly integrate with our existing Salesforce configuration to minimize disruptions to our current workflow.\n\u00a0\nEmail Attachment: The generated PDF report should be automatically attached to the monthly vendor performance emails sent to customers.",

The legacy app was replaced by the new DocuSign eSignature for Salesforce app from the DocuSign Apps Launcher package of apps.\n\u00a0\nMany Conga customers (including ourselves!) have invested heavily in the Conga / DocuSign combination for their document generation and signature solutions; retooling for another signature (or document) solution is costly and/or not practical. In fact, not only is Conga integrated with DocuSign, but so are portions of our website!\n\u00a0\nIt is becoming much more difficult to get support from DocuSign on their legacy product. When we have issues, technical support (which we pay extra for, BTW) is not always willing (or able!) to be helpful. The day will come when DocuSign legacy is no longer supported. Conga should be proactive about upgrading their core products to be compatible with early customers who have invested so heavily in these long standing integrations.\n\u00a0\nPlease make Composer and Trigger compatible with the new DocuSign Apps Launcher!",

    "content": "Allow Qvar to store multiple unique identifiers to be ingested by another query, thus enabling Composer to pull many child records from many parent records.\n\nUse Case 1: Customer makes multiple purchase in a day resulting in many orders that are 'related'. Operations would like shipments to be as cost effective as possible, this means warehouse staff needs to pick and ship inventory in the least amount of boxes as possible based on weight, dimensions and quantities sold on order lines. In order to do so, they will need a pick list printed for picking as well as a pack slip in the boxes before shipment is out the door.\n\nUse Case 2: Consolidated invoicing, similar to above, difference is a finance user is able to print out many invoice lines that are from multiple invoices belonging to the same customer or purchase order number.\n\nSolution: Allowing Composer to query child records based on the following logic (not a SOQL query)\n\nSELECT ProductName, Quantity, Weight, Dimension, Price\n\nFROM OrderLines\n\nWHERE ParentOrderIdentifier IN (QVar Result Set)\n\nIdea: Allow Qvar to store multiple identifiers to be used in another query's WHERE clause with IN. Based on numerous past test, current product capability does not allow that to happen, it gets very close though, the delimitator usually comes out wrong.\n\nIdeally, the feature can output errors when the query exceeds SFDC governance\\syntax limit similar to the errors we display for queries that went rough in the datafile today. These type of query can get out of hand fast if someone does not know what they are doing,",

Then while viewing the list of results records, End User *randomly* selects a subset of records from the full list by clicking on checkboxes of records. Then when End User has selected the random records desired from the list, they click a report generation button on the list view/object to output the record dataset to a *single* combined report.\n\nOne of the Business Examples:\n\nEnd User needs to search for sales or lease comparables by market, price, SF, etc using List View on custom Comparables object. Then when the list of 25-100 records fitting filter criteria is returned, End User will manually review the list to select 3-5 of what they feel are the best records to use for a client facing comparable report. The 3-5 selected records are output into a single report to be presented to the client.\n\nCurrent:\n\nClient is using Conga Composer and Grid. Original request was to be able to select and output the records from Grid view. We also discussed using List View as alternative. Conga has given mixed feedback on requiring the use of Batch to output random selected records into a single or multiple reports from Grid or Lightning List View. Pricing was quoted at $6k plus transaction fees for Batch. Cost and Use Case does not justify full use or cost benefit of typical Batch solution\u2014based on client feedback. CBRE is now asking about seeking alternative solutions including reviewing S-Docs to see if they can provide the functionality with their native solution.",
