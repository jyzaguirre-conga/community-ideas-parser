It would make it much easier/simpler for end users and admins to have control over security.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0This would also help with similar security concerns for Trigger - if the solution formula includes the Business Unit, and that set permissions for record/file access, it would be so much easier than the automations needed to configure access/ownership based on record details.",
