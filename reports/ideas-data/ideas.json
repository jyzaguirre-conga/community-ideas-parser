Moreover, if a user changes value in second attribute i.e. \u2018Attribute2\u2019 then it should allow the manual change. However, if the value in first attribute i.e. \u2018Attribute1\u2019 is changed then the second attribute should be defaulted again based on its value.\n\u00a0\nWe are able to achieve the same partially using field expression and keeping its field \u2018Ismodified\u2019 to true. But, if we change first attribute again after changing second attribute manually then field expression does not defaults the second attribute.\n\u00a0\nPAR in this case can default the value in second attribute but only once as PAR will not be executed once the attribute changes. Moreover, we can\u2019t have field expression and PAR written on the same attribute parallelly.\n\u00a0\nSo Idea is to have Field expression priority precede over manual intervention, moreover allow manual changes too on the target attribute if primary attribute remains the same.",

Similarly we have observed a behavior in our internal orgs that if we try to create checkbox field with API name containing IsFOCQuantity1__c, then too the issue is occurring, but if we create a checkbox type field with API name containing IsFOCQu1antity__c then it comes as checkbox on the cart page.\nThis seems to be the product behavior. The system checks for \"Quantity\" in API name and if found, it renders it as a text field that only takes the numerical values similar to quantity input field.",

This occurs due to a Salesforce limitation. When an approver responds via email, the system uses the context user's permissions to approve the request. Therefore, even if the approver lacks permission for the approval request, they can still approve it via email. We request an enhancement where the approver's permissions are checked instead of the context user's permissions when approving a request via email. This would ensure that only those with permission for the approval request object can approve the request. We request that this idea be considered for future product enhancement if possible.\n\u00a0\nRegards,\nConga Technical Support",

    "content": "Background :\nCustomer is looking for the mark field in third party documents which are getting uploaded to system using import offline functionality. And they are not generated through existing templates in the system.\n\u00a0\nThey are trying to use 'mark field' on such documents using XAC 2.0 but it is giving error as 'Please select a content that is compatible with the chosen field. The selected value May 9, 2024 is not compatible with the field data type DATE (MM/DD/YYYY)'\n\u00a0\nIn the Documents which the Customer is Importing, if the date values are in \"MMMM d, yyyy\" format, eg: \"March 4, 2024\". And when we try to mark this value against any date field(Agreement Start Date or Agreement End Date, etc) we are getting the following error message: Please select a content that is compatible with the chosen field. The selected value March 4, 2024 is not compatible with the field data type DATE (MM/DD/YYYY)\n\u00a0\n--> And if we change the Date value from \"March 4, 2024\" --> \"03/04/2024\"(MM/DD/YYYY) then it works\n\u00a0\nCustomer's concerns:\nif they update the date format to match the supported format i.e. (MM/DD/YYYY) , then when an agreement is viewed globally and date is displayed in agreements as \"03/04/2024\", it is very confusing. People from US will assume end date is March 4th (mm/dd/yyyy) but people from India will assume it is April 3rd (dd/mm/yyyy). The date format changes globally. That's why we want the format as \"March 4, 2024\" to avoid confusion\n\u00a0\n--> We can only mark a date value against a date field using XAC2.0 only if the date value which is in (MM/DD/YYYY) format. Any other format apart from this is throws error\n\u00a0\n--> Why this limitation?\n\u00a0\n--> Customer's request: Date can be stored internally in the format \"mm/dd/yyyy\" but we are requesting for display format as \"Month dd, yyyy\" when user marks date field as smart field in third party agreement document\n\u00a0\nReferenced JIRA : https://conga.atlassian.net/browse/COREAPPS-11178\nTS Case : 00887530 \n\u00a0\nAs this is currently product limitation, customers are looking forward to consider this as enhancement.",

The intention of this calculation is to help configuration management leaders and administrators understand how complex the offering is and its impact on the configuration experience for the sales representatives. For example, the expectation is that offerings with their complexity score marked \u201cComplex\u201d shall have lower performance (higher load times for the configurator) while those marked \u201cLow\u201d shall have comparatively better performance (lower load times for the configurator).\n\u00a0\nConga has shared various parameters involved in loading of the bundle on configuration page. However, GEHC has not been able to relate the computed complexity score and the configurator load times/ performance. They have seen offerings with Complexity score \u201cLow\u201d have as much or sometimes even longer load times than offerings that have been marked complex.\n\u00a0\nThis makes it difficult to understand how to define the complexity of our offerings and the potential impact to the sales users. This is also preventing us from defining a framework for identifying and measuring offering complexity. This information is critical to determine how the platform can guide our administrators to optimize the offerings.\n\u00a0\nPlease refer the attached pdf document on the parameters used and the detailed analysis done by GE so far.",

A Resync button on individual Conga Sign Transactions would be the perfect solution to this issue.\n\u00a0\nCurrently I am specifically experiencing this when a user reassigns a recipient, but the new recipient record is not created, and the new recipient does not receive an email. The audit trail says the recipient was reassigned and the user can't reassign to a new person again as the record thinks it has already been reassigned.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Conga Production Team is currently the only team who can kick off a \"redrive\" to fix this issue. I think creating a Resync Button would be a quick and easy way to always ensure that nothing went wrong before having to reach out to Conga Support. Since Conga Sign is only half native to Salesforce, there will always be issues where things do not line up all the way. This button would allow for much quicker fixes to records that may have just stumbled along the way to completion.

One flag/field on the Agreement or we can reuse the \"QTC Profile\" and add a new picklist value - for example Non Standard\nWe expect that when this value is set (we can do it on our own, thru our custom logic)\n1.1.

For the same flag/field we hope we can have a one more option on:\nOrder System Properties => System Properties => Order Item Activate Batch Size\nWhy we need that\nMost of the Agreements (maybe 95%) are with very simple Bundles (few Options) where we can use bigger size for example 10 or 20,\nbut currently we are forced to use 1 - because of the scenarios as the one described above\nAs you expect this since one is making activation of the Agreements quite slower than before but we don't have a choice as we can't dynamically change it per Agreement.\nThis we think is way less complex than the one above as it will just read the setting and apply the Batch Size for the OrderActivateJob\nSo what we expect is 1 new Option:\nOrder System Properties => System Properties => Order Item Activate Batch Size (Existing for Enterprise flag) which we can bump to 10\nOrder System Properties => System Properties => Order Item Activate Batch Size (New one for Non Standard flag) that we will put to 1 as it is now for all our cases",

    "content": "Use case : When user does copy operation in the shopping cart, Externally configured (through third party configurators) items needs to be copied into configurator. For that, configurator provided Silent copy API. This API will create copy of the line-item inside the configurator and run validation to update latest configuration and pricing and then saves all the data back to SFDC Line item & related child object using REST API exposed on SFDC side.\n\u00a0\nCurrent Solution: \nWe are using OOB Copy action button inside shopping cart.We are using OOB beforeCopyBundleLineItems method of Action callback class to populate two custom fields (Is copied from & Copy Is In Progress)OOB copy operation will create new line item and will copy all the fields from previous/copied from Line item to new line item.Turbo Pricing will get execute for new line item.In TP callback\u2019s onPriceItemSet method we invoke third party configurator API (silentCopy) to get the item copied into configurator.Configurator will create the item and validate the configuration & pricing \u00a0and at last will save back all the data on SFDC via REST API exposed on SFDC.Configurator will send back the response to TP callback silentCopy API call.Pricing will continue and post completion, Line item data saved back to shopping cart as part of OOB Turbo sync.\n\u00a0\nProblems in current architecture :\nConfigurator updates back the Line-item data on SFDC while price call is in progress on the Turbo side.Now SFDC line-item has updated data(price fields) but turbo still has old line-item data, so we will be ending up with incorrect prices and configuration in the shopping cart. Moreover, Turbo sync will overwrite the Line item data and possibility of loosing data saved back by the configurator.Reason behind using TP callback to invoke silentCopy API was the absence of any pre-price hook or unavailability of afterCopy function on SFDC side. Also, we can\u2019t use Line item trigger since external callout from trigger will not be supported.Sometimes configurators takes more than 30 seconds to respond back since copy/validation is complex operation so we might face Turbo time out issues. Though we can mitigate this issue by increasing Turbo time out value.\n\u00a0\nCurrent Architecture Diagram",

Depending on the contract, CCI might pull out something like \"90 days before the termination of this contract\", which is a text value and not a date value. Currently, unless the user fixes the CCI extraction to be an actual Date, when they complete the review on the document:\nthe sync will failthe document status will go to \"Error - Error in Review\"the user will see an unhelpful message about the data type not being valid (Note: it is helpful for admins, but end users will not understand it at all)the document must be re-submitted and the entire review process starts from scrach\nThis is a very poor UX for end users who know nothing about Salesforce architecture and can't be expected to know and match every data type on their mapped provisions during CCI review. The worst part of it is that there is no way to resolve the errors and the user must start over. This frankly makes the product borderline unusable and must be rectified ASAP. Note that the solution of only mapping CCI provisions to text fields will more or less ensure this issue doesn't happen, but it also ruins reporting capabilities by not using native SF field data types as designed\n\u00a0\nUser Story:\nAs an end user reviewing documents uploaded into CCI, I should not have to know the data types of the fields that my provisions are being mapped into.

They should see an \"Approve for signature\" button instead of \"Accept and complete signing\" button.

To modify an existing layout through WEB UI - when you create a transaction and applies the existing layout. In the same page, you can modify the layout and then press save layout. When the option for Save Layout appears, you can search for the existing layout name and apply the changes which will overwrite the existing layout.\n\u00a0\n2. To delete a saved layout, you have two options:\n\u00a0\na) Download the tool available from our developers which will allow you to delete layouts under your accounts.

This field is on the cart so if this is edited, then it'll ask for repricing and this can't be skipped.2 - We may create a serious risk w.r.to collections for other customers. E.g., Say, if a persona like Billing Analyst directly changes the frequency from \"Monthly\" to \"Quarterly\" without an ABO/Order transaction, there's no easy way to track change for the managers hence it'll potentially skip the approvals. In the eyes of the audit, it can also go to an extent where the Billing Analyst might have acted in favor of customer by differing the payment that was supposed to come now, thus creating a SOX issue as well.That said - we are actively thinking about giving control to the admins to determine what billing fields must be included/skipped from pricing. This requires coordination with CPQ as they own the cart.Thanks for the idea,Praneeth Bhavi"

Can you please help in creating a product jira for the same?\nMore information below. This is for Hitachi Energy.\n\u00a0\nFor the TS ticket (00864899), the issue was that a custom field APTS_ABB_Source_Location__c was not getting passed to turbo when we add a product to the cart.\n\u00a0\nWe got the resolution that we should have this parameter i.e. prestoAppId in the cart URL. When we have this parameter i.e. prestoAppId in URL, then the system makes a call for callPrestoForCart action and subsequently the system calls getCartLineItems. In getCartLineItems, we get updated value in APTS_ABB_Source_Location__c, hence that value is getting passed in Web Socket calls successfully.\n\u00a0\nWhen we do not pass prestoAppId in the cart url, the system doesn't call callPrestoForCart and getCartLineItems explicitly, hence when we land on cart, the system doesn't get an updated value in APTS_ABB_Source_Location__c. This causes the aforementioned issue, as we are currently not passing the prestoAppId in the cart url.\n\u00a0\nFrom a UAT unblocking perspective this resolution sounds good, but our recommendation is that the above solution is only a temporary workaround. Because the presto app id is supposed to be passed on only for cost related calculations, hence it should not be needed to be passed on the cart when we are not doing any pricing calls.\n\u00a0\nThis requires a product fix such that it should be possible to send the value of a custom field on the line item to the turbo without using the presto app id in the cart url.

To build a solution where call is invoked from Turbo PCB and Presto Callback basis the cost model association is a very expensive way to build any Integration \u2013 as we have to replicate authentication, authorization, parsing, error handling & logging framework on both Turbo and SFDC side as there is no reusability possible between the two.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe need a capability to have Cost Data available in Turbo context and further some cost ruleset feature for cost engine.",

This is preventing our users from selecting a contact to send the Conga document to. The support agent handling this case let us know that this is just how the form works and it's a data issue. \nWe have some duplicate to clean up, but why would this form hide both of the contacts and not just one of them. This is causing our users to go off-system to email documents to contacts, when they could very easily send from within the system.\n\u00a0\nI'm not sure why the search would not match the search results that are returned in a generic SF search, can we alter this search to display all contacts? There should not be a automatic filter in place that hides contacts.\nIf there is no desire to change this, then at least provide a tool tip icon that explains the filters that are in place today. We were not expecting any filtering on this email form and it's causing end-user confusion when they cannot find their contacts in this search.\n\u00a0\nCan the filter be removed?",

However, during repricing, the system indicates there are pending changes on the line item, prompting users to click the wrench and configure these changes. Subsequently, users might click on the configuration icon and find no modifications are required. This situation leads to unnecessary confusion and requires additional troubleshooting resources to find why an available catalog product is \"not working\".\n\u00a0\nTo enhance user experience and streamline the process, it is suggested that the system dynamically manages expiration dates for active products.

Although such promotions may appear to be limited to B2C scenarios, they are also present in B2B.\nAs part of this concept, several features could be incorporated, such as:\n1) Automatically adding a benefit product to the shopping cart, even if it has not or already been added\n2) Removing the benefit quantity line if the item on which the promotion was applied is removed from the shopping cart\n3) Making the benefit quantity line read-only (in case added as a sperate line)\n4) Clearly marking the product line with a different color or icon to indicate that it has been automatically added as part of the promotion\n5) Including the benefit quantity as a free quantity, meaning that there is no pricing impact\nSuggestion: It may be more challenging to apply this idea to complex bundle products, so it could be limited to the standalone items.",

Please also see the image attached.\nAbility to have a 3 column view on the assignment details tab on collaboration dialog box. Currently the fields are displayed in a 2 column format. If we have more fields then user has to scroll down. For Hitachi Energy we will have more fields on this tab, and hence want to be able to display all the fields in single view without having to scroll.Ability to provide a URL to open an external page. Currently on the 'completed configuration' tab, there is a link called 'more details' which opens a read only child cart configuration. We want a similar hyperlink to be created on the assignment details tab that will take the user to the collaboration header object. But when we add a field containing the url, it is getting displayed as a text, not as a hyperlink.The collaboration breadcrumb statuses that are displayed on the top of the dialog box - Is it possible to be able to update the labels of the various stages ? Hitachi Energy wants to have the collaboration status tied to quote/proposal stages (draft, submitted, approved etc). We were able to update the collaboration status picklist labels in the field Apttus_Config2__Status__c. But these labels are not getting reflected on the collaboration dialog box. Is there a way to update these labels?",

The % complete indicates the % of jobs completed, not the % of priced items. This is a very generic job monitoring API that is meant to display a busy indicator rather than an accurate measure of the task.\n\u00a0\nWhat is expected here is the 'no of jobs completed' and 'Total no of jobs' as a result of this API. As we know that how many items are there and what is the pricing batch size, so we can easily calculate the both results.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEg. - 100 items are there which are pending, and batch size is 5 then 100/5 = 20 will be the 'Total no of jobs' submitted in back end. When 'Compute total in separate steps' checkbox is checked then we can increase the Total no of jobs with 1. So it will be 21 .\n\u00a0\nIt is very general calculation similar to it happens in batch process. Similar thing can be implement in this new API.",

Here currently he/she can accept the collaboration or update the collaboration and resend it.\nThe scenario is what if the initiator wants to accept one of the line items and not the remaining two.

As mentioned in the other idea, we will not be implementing it. Below are the reasons:\nFor the CPQ, initially, it was offered at the quote level. But, there have been asks from the customer community to support it at the Agreement and Order levels. Product responded to the new request by offering the functionality at the \"cart\" level since all the Propose & Quote / Negotiate & Execute / Manage & Fulfill products have \"cart\" as a common object. This cart functionality is our newer offering.For the strategic customer in the subject, if their Salesreps can access to Agreement, they should be able to access the cart, create just the plan without touching anything else (they can create the agreement flow accordingly), reprice and finalize the cart. The plan is created OOTB.\nUnless we hear a justified business reason (not accessing the cart is not such reason) from the customer, we don't see further value in giving this functionality at the agreement level.Once again, we appreciate your contribution to this space.Thanks & Regards,Praneeth BhaviProduct Manager for Manage & Fulfill."

We believe this should suffice the requirement hence we don't plan to enhance here.We understand that some customers may not use agreement-level cart, but we don't see any risk in extending the permissions to the Salesrep to the agreement-level cart. If Salesreps are permitted to create a billing plan at this stage in the business transaction, then they should be permitted to access the cart as well. The salesreps can open the cart, create a billing plan, re-price & finalize the cart without touching any other pricing fields. Once this process is established, it will be seamless.What we would appreciate is if the users experience any issues in creating the plan from the agreement cart. That will be a big value add to this functionality to the rest of the community.If there are any concerns with my explanation, please feel free to get in touch with us through the appropriate Conga channel and I'll be happy to discuss.Thank you again for your idea,Praneeth BhaviConga Product Management for \"Manage & Fulfill.\""

This is causing a lot of confusion and inconvenience in GE Healthcare.\n\u00a0\nWhen their business users are selling service bundles and they come to bundle configuration page, they see \"0\" as that is the list price configured on the PLI. This misleads them to believe that the option has a \"0\" price and can be given for free. However, when to go to the cart, then they are able to view the final price from matrix. To avoid this confusion and to-and-fro between cart and bundle configuration page, they want to see the final matrix price for the option on the bundle configuration page itself.\n\u00a0\nGE would like to have this feature in the June'23 release as it is impacting one of their biggest regions, USCAN.

For visibility settings, our organization uses a cover sheet that I would like to be able to make visible to internal parties only.

User is configuring both bundles with this option. he set constraint rule which checks if both bundles are from the same location or not. If both bundles have the same location then it throws a validation message to override the base price to 0 for the option 'D'. However, both bundles are from different locations but still they can see this validation.\n\u00a0\nAnalysis:\nWe have discussed this use case with our engineering team. We got confirmation that this scenario is not supported, and constraint rules with match-in locations won't be helpful in satisfying this new use case that user is trying to implement it.\n\u00a0\nAlso, 'Match in location' is only supported for some of the 'inclusion use' cases. It's not fully supported, for exclusion or validation.\nHence, this current use case will not be fulfilled by CR. However, there is another solution is you can write a validation callback to achieve this scenario.\n\u00a0\n-- User has requested enhancement for this issue.

    "author": "Matt Penrod",
    "product": "Conga_Contracts_for_salesforce",
    "content": "Following is our detailed description to our Conga Partner Manager and the Client. We have been asked to log a ticket with Support/Product Team, as this is a known issue with the Composer product and affects 90% of our builds. We can usually design around it, but it was a blocker with no solution on this particular project. Colton mentioned a possible solution that had recently been developed, but wasn't able to find documentation on it. From what he described, that solution would fix this bug.\n\u00a0\n\"Upon further investigation into the document generation issue with Tevora\u2019s SOWs (Fixed/Hybrid), we\u2019ve discovered that a problem we thought might be a relatively easy fix in the templates themselves is actually due to an inherent flaw in the Conga Composer product. We encounter this flaw fairly often while building and are sometimes able to design around it. However, in a project like this one where templates and clauses are so heavily dependent on unordered (bullet-pointed) lists, it is nearly impossible to circumvent.\n\u00a0\nThe issue lies with the addition of extra paragraph <p> tags following unordered lists. This causes each new paragraph in a given clause following an unordered list to generate as a new, separate clause. This causes Word\u2019s auto-numbering to recognize each paragraph following a </ul> tag in a clause as a new number, throwing off the auto-numbering and formatting in the document.\n\u00a0\nUsually, this is a problem we can solve by going into Custom Settings and enabling \u201cclean p tags\u201d and \u201cclean ul tags.\u201d However, in this project, \u201cclean p tags\u201d does not resolve the issue. \u201cClean ul tags\u201d cannot be utilized due to the reliance on bulleted lists in the templates. We believe it\u2019s possible that restructuring the clause configuration in the library to include any extra paragraph after a <ul> in a clause as a subclause and adding a subclause merge tag in the template may circumvent the product flaw in Composer. However, there are a few major pain points with this solution:\n\u00a0\nThere are over 90 separate clauses of this clause type currently in the clause library- one for each product available to SOWs. Some of these clauses contain only one paragraph following the unordered list, but many of them contain two paragraphs. Each of these paragraphs would have to be re-added into the library as new clauses and associated to the originals as subclauses for this to operate correctly.\n\u00a0\nThe manner in which the implementation was originally designed would operate correctly for any type of clause except those containing unordered lists. It is only the presence of unordered lists in each clause that causes the document to generate incorrectly. With adoption and ease of use in mind, creating an overly-complicated design to circumvent a known flaw in the product may hamper the ability of future Tevora admins to add new products/clauses to their system. This could lead to a decrease in use and adoption, and an eventual deprecation of product use altogether.\n\u00a0\nThe only other solution to this issue would be to ask the client to fundamentally change the look/feel of their templates to remove bullet-pointed lists altogether. Tevora is understandably unwilling to do this, and we feel they shouldn\u2019t have to. If they chose this option in the end nonetheless, this would also necessitate a retooling of the clause library and clause library for over 90 clauses.\"",

The user selects sub bundles to attribute however it is expected that it cascades to its option but it does not happen the first time.

The reason behind this is (As per you mentioned) Whenever we select the option \"Custom Compliance Analytics Onboarding Services\" , we call the updateCartLineItems method. This inserts the Apttus_Config2__ProductAttributeValue__c object at the option and sub-option level. If the user selects the attribute before this call gets complete then the issue occurs.\n\nIf we change the code so that the attribute is cascaded before updateCartLineItems is called, then there will be a huge impact on the product and may result in lots of regression issues.\n\nThe user wants this to be considered as an enhancement for the future.",

We have already recommended 'Office 365 review process' to them to avoid this, but they have requested below mentioned feature on XAC 2.0.\n\nCustomer's Suggestion :\n\n* Once the review process is complete, when the Contract Manager or owner checks out the final merged copy, under Doc Fields tab in XAC, they should be able to see the fields value submitted by each reviewer.\n* Customer's expectation is to see additional fields (with reviewer's name as Header) and the field value which was submitted by them in review check-in process.\n\nThe customer has notified us that they have an upcoming renewal and if they are not able to achieve their requirement, they might consider other products.\n\nCustomer- Michelin\n\nReference case - 00814703",

System generates a auto response based on metadata file name. The auto response email template do not have merge field so we can identify which agreement was not successful.\n\n\nSolution provided by engineering team:\n\nJira >> CLM-8149\n\nWhen user respond via email and system gets the email, then system does not know for which agreement or for which document this email has come; so system uses metadata of the document to find out the document and agreement details. But if the document is not correct, then it will not find the right metadata within the document and hence this email is sent out. Here if the document is wrong then there is no way to know for which agreement or document this updated document has come, so it is not feasible to add merge field in the email template for this specific case. So we can not do much about it, however customer can add more user friendly text if they want and hence this template is provided.\n\n\nAs the reason customer is requesting the below:\n\nThe user needs to be identified which email failed and which email has the wrong attachment. For example, the User can have 3-4 agreements submitted to the business. If the 3rd agreement attachment was wrong and the user needs to get identified like which agreement's attachment was wrong.",

However, Salesforce would like to scale further and evaluated Conga Async Approvals.\n\n\nAs-Is: Conga provides async approvals via below two approaches:\n\n1. Custom Setting: Process Preview/Submit Asynchronously\n\nPros:\n\n- Customers can retain the existing OOB UI for preview and Submit with comments\n\n- No need to write any custom code to use async approvals\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Every approval in the org will go for async processing. This will increase the overall number of jobs in the queue. And for smaller quotes, async processing may also take more time than sync processing.\n\n\n2. Async API: Apttus_Approval.ApprovalsWebService.SubmitForApprovalsAsync(sObjectType, sObjectId)\n\nPros:\n\n- Customers will have flexibility to decide at run time (based on defined threshold) whether the approvals need to go to async process or not. This will involve custom code\n\nCons:\n\n- No Preview and Submit with Comments available\n\n- Custom code is required to consume the API\n\n\nAsk:\n\n1. Enabling async approvals by just having a switch at runtime is the most easiest and scalable solution that we are looking for. Instead of having custom setting at org level, can we have this type of parameter passed during runtime? We would like to retain our Preview and Submit with Comments UI.\n2.

When two (or more parties) negotiate the various terms and clauses in a contract, what they are really doing is determining the obligations of both parties involved in the contract. Here's a simple but effective and fairly validated idea for an effective obligation management solution, where you start with the usual contract negotiation, arrive at the final set of negotiated clauses at signatures, tag those negotiated clauses as which ones need to be tracked as obligations, categorize the obligations, assign an accountable and responsible owner to the obligations, determine how the obligation should be assessed for compliance (in most cases it would be an assessment survey questionnaire) and lastly determine the number of times in a year you would want to assess the obligatino for compliance. Now the system automatically creates TASKS that send an email notification to the responsible (and accountable) persons as the tasks fall due. The email contains a link to an assessment survey (leveraging Salesforce communities here) which can be filled out by the responsible person and submitted. This submission is captured on the obligation and based on the submitted responses, the accountable person can determine whether the obligation is in compliance, at risk of non compliance or is already in jeopardy.",

However, the email received after the job completion is having very minimal information. It is one liner email saying that the batch job is completed.\n\nThere seems to be no email template behind this email and hence customers cannot customize the email going out to the users submitting a cart for async pricing.\n\n\nProduct team also recommended another API (BatchJobService.updatePriceForCart()) that is queueable but Salesforce cannot go with it for now due to certain challenges in error handling\n\n\nImpact: Although the async pricing API solves the purpose of not running into governor limits, this is not creating a good user experience. It creates a lot of ambiguity.\n\n\nAsk: Having a configurable option to turn off/on the emails completely so that customers can have their own customized emails with relevant content in the email body.",

Working - Non-working- Analysis in Customer Org: When user add a product named 'Cardio Black Pearl' and configure its attributes and other Options, few Options of 'Extras for Cardio' OptionGroup are auto-included as a part of inclusion rules. In Summer 20, those auto-included Options are not visible in right sidebar of bundle config page as shown in above screen-shot. But other options are visible. Observed that IsHidden flag of Extras for Cardio' OptionGroup is enabled that is why that OptionGroup is not visible on the cart but at the same time Options are not visible in the right-side bar. In Summer 17, customer has the same product setup. There also IsHidden flag of Extras for Cardio' OptionGroup is enabled and that OptionGroup is not visible on the cart but at the same time Options are visible in the right-side bar.

(2) Also, the use of \"Business Days\" is problematic for the following reasons: what exactly is a Business Day \u2014 US Federal Holidays excluded (why US and not Canada, Mexico, or some other country), State holidays excluded (which State), weekends excluded, does a business day start at 9am and en at 5pm and what time zone, what happens when a contract is submitted in Conga at 5:01pm on Friday and all work flow steps are completed and agreement executed at 5:03pm on Friday - if we are going by Business Day then how is that reported in the duration report?\n\n\nHOW DO YOU FEEL THE REQUESTED FUNCTIONALITY WILL ALLOW YOU TO RESOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\n\nDuration reports should automatically be reported in Conga as a numeric value only that can be filtered by Excel so that true metric reports on how long a particular \"Flow Step\" took can be reported. Also, there are way too many variables with \"Business Days\" as a time period - get rid of business days and just use a 24 hour period.\n\n\nCall me to discuss if I was unclear or if further information is needed. From my position, this is not really an \"enhancement\" but correcting an error in that is preventing true and useful metric duration reports from being created.\n\n\nRevance Therapeutics, Inc\n\nPaco Armijo\n\nparmijo@revance.com\n\n510-588-7062",

Currently we only have it at org level in the custom setting.\n\nWhen customer has multi currency enabled in salesforce org, there are valid scenarios when customer needs to define rounding modes differently for each currency based on each country's norms. For example, for USD customer might want to keep HALF_EVEN whereas for JPY they would like to keep it different.\n\nIf we can facilitate out of the box way to define rounding modes per flow/currency basis by any means of configuration or providing a callback hook for customers to implement their own rounding logic for each flow/currency then it that would be great addition to multi currency features support by Conga.",

This is fine if you've produced a PDF as part of checking in a final Agreement Document revision (in which case the PDF is present in 'Files' or 'Notes & Attachments'), but if you haven't, and you instead want to send an Agreement Document revision, you have to search for it, which our contact viewed as a much-less-than-optimal user experience.\n\nNokia would instead like to see the latest revisions of all Document Versions also included in the 'Available Documents', exactly as is done in the Adobe Sign Adapter.",

Messages sent from both internal and external sources should be able to view and embed images. If the image were to fail to load within the message they would instead be attached so that all files are preserved and maintained consistently in the message chain.\n\nFrequently in our work, our users utilize image/screenshot files to assist with their day to day activities, ordinary course business tasks, workflows and reviews. It would be beneficial for Western overall if we had the ability to embed image/screenshot files within Conga email messages as noted above.\n\nAs Western Admin, we would like to resolve the image/screenshot files problem so our users can have a more productive, efficient and streamlined review and messaging communication experience. Currently, screenshots are not being embedded in Conga Messaging emails and are thus converted to broken URLs when processed through the API. This add functionality is integral to our day to day business and record keeping.\n\nThis functionality will allow Western users to more quickly and efficiently view image/screenshot files within Conga messages which will assist substantially in enhancing the review experience and productivity for users, and will reduce/eliminate the need to reference third party platforms for image/screenshot files.\n\n-Please see attached-",

The sales rep may want to apply an additional discount on the quote as is \u2013 or maybe there is upselling and discount as part of the conversion. The only way the sales rep can do the discounting is through the quote summary and it is paramount, that the discounting happens consistently across the quote. As negative prices are allowed and as discounts through the quote summary are supported, we expected the value to populate the \"Net Adjustment Percent\" field when -ve is applied. With -ve the field value is Null.\nSee attached screenshot where 20% discount was already applied.

The Price List Item of the products which are configured on the Cart are NOT having Related Pricing. 3. They have their own custom flow or use case. For that, they are using our RelatedLineItem Object. 4. The user is configuring one of the Product which they are saying as Hardware or Software Product. 5. Along with the Hardware/Software Product, they are adding Coverage Product on the same Cart. 6. The Hardware, Software & Coverage are the custom types of the Product. 7. So here, the customer wants to create a Relationship between Hardware/Software Products and Coverage Products. 8. To achieve that, they are using our OOTB RelatedLineItem object. The user is creating Hardware/Software LineItem along with Coverage LineItem. RelatedLineItem object is working as a junction object between these 2 LineItems. So, they are putting LineItem as Hardware/Software LineItem Id and RelatedLineItem as Coverage LineItem Id. Along with that, they are putting a Dummy Asset on the RelatedAssetLineItem Id. Because without RelatedAssetLineItem Id, the system will throw NullPointerException. 9. The RelatedAssetLineItem field will have the actual AssetLineItem Id only when they are doing renewals. We explained that the OOTB system will never populate the RelatedLineItem lookup field with another LineItem in case of Service CPQ. But the customer is using this customization since more than a year and they don't want to change anything. The implementation was done by the Partner. As per him, the system can copy everything correctly from RelatedLineItem to ProposalRelatedLineItem to OrderRelatedLineItem or RelatedAssetLineItem. The system is also able to clone the correct data (on new configuration) if we configure the already Finalized Quote. Hence, the issue is only on the Deep Cloning of the Quote using Apttus_QPConfig__ProposalClone VF page. So as per the customer's request, we wanted to know whether this can be fixed from our end or not? They are also OK if we can provide this as an Enhancement or Story. FYI: JIRA: CPQ-50745",

In order to do so, they will need a pick list printed for picking as well as a pack slip in the boxes before shipment is out the door.\n\nUse Case 2: Consolidated invoicing, similar to above, difference is a finance user is able to print out many invoice lines that are from multiple invoices belonging to the same customer or purchase order number.\n\nSolution: Allowing Composer to query child records based on the following logic (not a SOQL query)\n\nSELECT ProductName, Quantity, Weight, Dimension, Price\n\nFROM OrderLines\n\nWHERE ParentOrderIdentifier IN (QVar Result Set)\n\nIdea: Allow Qvar to store multiple identifiers to be used in another query's WHERE clause with IN.

Then when End User has selected the random records desired from the list, they click a report generation button on the list view/object to output the record dataset to a *single* combined report.\n\nOne of the Business Examples:\n\nEnd User needs to search for sales or lease comparables by market, price, SF, etc using List View on custom Comparables object. Then when the list of 25-100 records fitting filter criteria is returned, End User will manually review the list to select 3-5 of what they feel are the best records to use for a client facing comparable report. The 3-5 selected records are output into a single report to be presented to the client.\n\nCurrent:\n\nClient is using Conga Composer and Grid. Original request was to be able to select and output the records from Grid view. We also discussed using List View as alternative. Conga has given mixed feedback on requiring the use of Batch to output random selected records into a single or multiple reports from Grid or Lightning List View. Pricing was quoted at $6k plus transaction fees for Batch. Cost and Use Case does not justify full use or cost benefit of typical Batch solution\u2014based on client feedback.

Even worse is when they click on Configure again, this starts another Cart tab - so now you have two Cart tabs and it's easy to remember which is the active one.\n* Submit for Approval - when submitting for approval, similar to finalize, several tabs open up.

This is frustrating for users who don't remember to close the tab\n* Any Custom VF page opened through a Cart Action, when it redirects back to the Cart, this will result in a separate tab being opened for the Cart.

Now the user can send for signatures again, select file and go through the process all over resulting in 2 envelopes getting created (I have noticed if the back button is clicked too soon, status of the first envelope remains blank). However, Docusign console shows 2 envelopes with the status 'Waiting for others'. In this scenario, the recipient would receive two emails with separate envelopes and is able to open and sign both. After signatures are completed, batch jobs that run at every 15 min interval in the background look for any signed envelopes and insert the signed document under files, then update the agreement status to fully signed and update the envelope status to Completed. If the recipient had signed both envelopes in this case, we see both signed docs under Files section, but the Agreement/Envelope Status update fails.\n\n\nI think we can put in some logic to prevent creation of multiple envelopes at the same time or almost immediately after first envelope is created.\n\nThis has been a consistent and major issue for Fannie Mae (Case#'s 00105836 & 00115083) even after several user trainings and needs some control to built in to the product.",

This can result in the incorrect version of the file being sent for signature when there is more than one version created on the same day that the most recent version was created.\n\nThe workaround is to either delete older file versions (unacceptable for our use case because we need to have history available), or to download the most recent file version and upload it back in as an entirely separate contentdocument and set that as primary (cumbersome workaround). We also can potentially catch this issue by previewing our file on the Conga Sign screen before sending, although users don't always do this or may not always see the version differences easily to catch the issue.\n\nWe are unfortunately going to have to create automation specifically to address this bug because it is not being fixed by Conga (or not in a timely fashion). The fact that Conga Sign will send out a version other than the most recent file version really reduces our faith in Conga Sign as a platform because certain version changes can be critical and these are documents going to our client or potential clients, therefore reducing our clients' faith in us if we accidentally send an older version of the file.\n\nIt should be relatively straightforward to order by ContentModifiedDate with the level of specificity necessary or IsLatest flag or utilize VersionNumber comparisons to identify the most recent version of a document.",

Do you want to proceed?'.\n\n\nSo I believe we should have the flexibility for the customers to make it mandatory for the submitters to select the document/attachment before submitting it for approval. So we would need the hard error message on the screen if the submitter is not selecting any attachment after clicking on Submit With Attachment button.\n\n\nWe may use the Approvals Custom Config (custom setting) for the same where we can put a checkbox to mark the attachments mandatory. So the customer can decide to use this feature based on the Approvals Custom Config of the respective Context Object.\n\n\nThanks!",

Currently when a contract is reassigned from one company to another the responsibilities are kept as they are, in particular an assignment to a company person is now assigned to a person at a company that is no longer a party to the contract and who is therefore ineligible to be reselected as fulfilling that responsibility.\n\nThis issue could be resolved in multiple ways, either by removing responsible persons from the contract who are not eligible after reassignment or by moving those persons to the new company. However, both of those options present problems - in the first case, the contract cannot be resaved in the case of required responsibilities now being unfilled, and in the second case it may not be correct that the person has moved to the new company along with the contract. Both of these options also are a breaking change in the application.",

Also the customers and partners are then dependent on TS to get the subscriber logs, but that too does not provide such detail Errors.\n\n\nError reporting Required:\n\n1) Enhance the maintenance console to report on such bad configuration data (if required field is blank or referring to non-existed field. So the admin can look for such data at one place and handle clean-up proactively\n\n2) Enhance the Error reporting on transaction time by providing the rule reference which is causing the issue so that diagnosis and fix can happen fast.\n\n\n| Object | Field | Comments |  |\n| Apttus_Config2_ProductAttributeRule_c (Product Attribute Rule)  | APTTUS_CONFIG2_CONDITIONCRITERIAEXPRESSION_C (Condition Criteria Expression) | Look for Apttus_Config2_AttributeValueId_r. | SELECT Id, Name, APTS_Ext_ID__c, Apttus_Config2__ConditionCriteriaExpression__c FROM Apttus_Config2__ProductAttributeRule__c |\n| Apttus_Config2_ProductAttributeRuleAction_c (Product Attribute Rule Action) | APTTUS_CONFIG2_FIELD_C (Target Attribute) |  | SELECT Id, Name, Apttus_Config2__Field__c, APTS_Ext_ID__c FROM Apttus_Config2__ProductAttributeRuleAction__c |\n| Constraint Rule Action (Apttus_Config2_ConstraintRuleAction_c) | APTTUS_CONFIG2_ACTIONCRITERIA_C (Condition Criteria) | Look for Apttus_Config2_AttributeValueId_r. | SELECT Id, Name, Apttus_Config2__ActionCriteria__c, APTS_Ext_ID__c FROM Apttus_Config2__ConstraintRuleAction__c |\n| Constraint Rule Condition (Apttus_Config2_ConstraintRuleCondition_c) | Apttus_Config2_ConditionCriteria_c (Condition Criteria) | Look for Apttus_Config2_AttributeValueId_r. | SELECT Id, Name, APTS_Ext_ID__c, Apttus_Config2__ConditionCriteria__c FROM Apttus_Config2__ConstraintRuleCondition__c |\n| Price List Item (Apttus_Config2_PriceListItem_c) | Apttus_Config2_Criteria_c (Charge Type Criteria) | Look for Apttus_Config2_AttributeValueId_r. | SELECT Id, Name, APTS_Ext_ID__c, Apttus_Config2__Criteria__c FROM Apttus_Config2__PriceListItem__c where Apttus_Config2__HasCriteria__c = true |\n| Price Dimensions (Apttus_Config2_PriceDimension_c) | Apttus_Config2_Datasource_c (Field) |  | SELECT Id, Name, APTS_Ext_ID__c, Apttus_Config2__AttributeId__c, Apttus_Config2__BusinessObject__c, Apttus_Config2__Type__c, Apttus_Config2__Datasource__c, Apttus_Config2__ContextType__c FROM Apttus_Config2__PriceDimension__c where Apttus_Config2__BusinessObject__c = 'Apttus_Config2__ProductAttributeValue__c'\n\n |\n| Price Matrix Entry (Apttus_Config2_PriceMatrixEntry_c) | Apttus_Config2_Condition_c (Condition) | Look for Apttus_Config2_AttributeValueId_r. | select Id, Apttus_Config2__Condition__c, APTS_Ext_ID__cfrom Apttus_Config2__PriceMatrixEntry__c |\n| Price Ruleset (Apttus_Config2_PriceRuleset_c) | APTTUS_CONFIG2_CRITERIA_C (Ruleset Criteria) | Look for Apttus_Config2_AttributeValueId_r. | SELECT Id, Name, APTS_Ext_ID__c,APTTUS_CONFIG2__CRITERIA__C FROM Apttus_Config2__PriceRuleset__c |\n| Price Rule Entry (Apttus_Config2_PriceRuleEntry_c) | APTTUS_CONFIG2_CONDITION_C (Condition) | Look for Apttus_Config2_AttributeValueId_r. |\n\nSELECT Id, Name, APTS_Ext_ID__c, Apttus_Config2__Condition__c FROM Apttus_Config2__PriceRuleEntry__c |\n| Product Attribute (Apttus_Config2_ProductAttribute_c) | Apttus_Config2_Field_c (Field) |  | SELECT Id, Name, Apttus_Config2__Field__c, APTS_Ext_ID__c FROM Apttus_Config2__ProductAttribute__c |\n| Approval Rule\n(Apttus_Approval_ApprovalRule_c) | Apttus_Approval_CriteriaFieldNames_c | Currently no entries that refer to PAV so can be skipped.  |\n\nSELECT Id, Apttus_Approval__Active__c, Apttus_Approval__CriteriaFieldNames__c, APTS_Ext_ID__c FROM Apttus_Approval__ApprovalRule__c |\n| Approval Rule Entry (Apttus_Approval_ApprovalRuleEntry_c)\n\n\n\n | Apttus_Approval_ConditionFieldNames_c\nApttus_Approval_CriteriaFieldNames_c | Look for Apttus_Config2_AttributeValueId_r. |\n |",

When making those changes, the contract reviewer wants to see the clauses change in real time when 'Replace' is clicked. Today, for a user to see the fall back clause go into the document, 'Save' needs to be pushed. That also creates a new version. Ideally, they would like these 5 clause changes be in 1 version.... which they can do if they hit replace, but then the 'fall back language' isn't in the document so reviewing their work is a challenge.

The organization and 2 hospitals are independent accounts and are not tied together by any hierarchy. In order to meet such a request, the salesperson needs to create a quote on organization account and fetch the assets of the 2 hospital accounts on the quote. As per current design, this is not possible. Currently, on the installed products page, we can fetch the assets of the account on which the quote is created or any account which is part of the quote account's account hierarchy. As part of this new feature, we should be able to fetch any asset for the accounts belonging to the same country and sell service on these assets. So, the assets on the installed product page should not be limited to the quote account hierarchy. Example: Salesperson from France should be able to quote service on assets belonging to any French account.",
