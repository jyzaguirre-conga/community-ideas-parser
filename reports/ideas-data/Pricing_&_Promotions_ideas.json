See no change in pricing, and contract price list item is not applied after repricing.Apply contract to the original line item. Contract price list item is then applied after repricing to the cloned line item. Original line item still retains it's own price list item due to asset pricing.\nThe ask is for the ability to apply contract pricing to the clone without having to apply the contract to the original line item.",

If we try applying incentives on both the scopes it applies benefit only once in the first bundle which has the lowest primary line number. The second bundle will never have the benefit applied even though the Promotion Scope & Benefit are present on both bundles.\n\u00a0\nScenario - 2\nOn the Cart, if we have 2 bundles and both of them have the scope and the benefit. There is one benefit that is already applied to the first bundle.\u00a0\nWhen we apply the promotion on the second bundle, we see that this promotion is not getting applied on the second bundle as there is a benefit that has already been applied on the first bundle\n\u00a0\nGEHC Business Use Case:\u00a0\nThe Customer needs the benefit to be applied on bundle level and not on the cart level.\nThe priority of assigning benefit products should be given to the bundle level first then to the cart level. But right now it applying on the cart level.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPromotion design gives a 10% discount on upgrading laptop storage to 1 TB\nUse case:\nExample: - In the cart we have two Laptop configure\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nIn my case, Just want to apply a Promotional discount to the second bundle/product (Dell XPS 14) -- but based on Scenario - 1 - the benefit is getting applied to the first benefit product that is, and the option/configure line of Bundle-1 (Dell Inspiron 5559).\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPlease find the attachment under the idea which has sample data use cases.",

The expectation is to show some symbol/icon to let the user know that there was a pricing error.\n\u00a0\nPS: We have setup a custom message on the cart when there is a pricing error.

Although such promotions may appear to be limited to B2C scenarios, they are also present in B2B.\nAs part of this concept, several features could be incorporated, such as:\n1) Automatically adding a benefit product to the shopping cart, even if it has not or already been added\n2) Removing the benefit quantity line if the item on which the promotion was applied is removed from the shopping cart\n3) Making the benefit quantity line read-only (in case added as a sperate line)\n4) Clearly marking the product line with a different color or icon to indicate that it has been automatically added as part of the promotion\n5) Including the benefit quantity as a free quantity, meaning that there is no pricing impact\nSuggestion: It may be more challenging to apply this idea to complex bundle products, so it could be limited to the standalone items.",

As we know that how many items are there and what is the pricing batch size, so we can easily calculate the both results.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEg. - 100 items are there which are pending, and batch size is 5 then 100/5 = 20 will be the 'Total no of jobs' submitted in back end.

    "content": "Hi team,\n\nGartner customer is looking for a way to facilitate currency fields rounding mode per country/currency/flow basis. Currently we only have it at org level in the custom setting.\n\nWhen customer has multi currency enabled in salesforce org, there are valid scenarios when customer needs to define rounding modes differently for each currency based on each country's norms. For example, for USD customer might want to keep HALF_EVEN whereas for JPY they would like to keep it different.\n\nIf we can facilitate out of the box way to define rounding modes per flow/currency basis by any means of configuration or providing a callback hook for customers to implement their own rounding logic for each flow/currency then it that would be great addition to multi currency features support by Conga.",

So the feature reuirement is in case of any chanhge on the price matrics Or price rules the product version should change automatically by OOTB from 1 to 2 OR 2 to 3. So that on the revalidate Price changed in the Price Matrix will now be reflected in the cart. So they can use the below functionality. https://documentation.conga.com/cpq/may-22/revalidating-the-product-configuration-181307550.html This can be done by writing the custom logic in the Revalidation callback class, where the Pricing Status will be updated based on the Product Version change.",

    "content": "Use Case:\nFor SimCorp, discounts are applied at quote summary level. This is used in combination with an approval workflow on both discount approvals and deal size approvals. Simcorp has some use cases, where named users are allowed to enter a pre-approved adjustment (controlled through collaboration.) The most important one is when converting existing clients from a perpetual contract to a subscription contract, so it is not an inferior case. It is part of contract transformations. The sales rep may want to apply an additional discount on the quote as is \u2013 or maybe there is upselling and discount as part of the conversion. The only way the sales rep can do the discounting is through the quote summary and it is paramount, that the discounting happens consistently across the quote. As negative prices are allowed and as discounts through the quote summary are supported, we expected the value to populate the \"Net Adjustment Percent\" field when -ve is applied. With -ve the field value is Null.\nSee attached screenshot where 20% discount was already applied. It doesn't show (right lower corner value .0,00% even when 20% was applied) This is confusing for the End Uses.",
