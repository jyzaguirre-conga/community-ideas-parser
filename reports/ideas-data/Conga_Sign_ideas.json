Sometimes there are even just brief connection issues or other random things that will cause our Salesforce Environment from not being 100% inline with what Conga has on their end. A Resync button on individual Conga Sign Transactions would be the perfect solution to this issue.\n\u00a0\nCurrently I am specifically experiencing this when a user reassigns a recipient, but the new recipient record is not created, and the new recipient does not receive an email. The audit trail says the recipient was reassigned and the user can't reassign to a new person again as the record thinks it has already been reassigned.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Conga Production Team is currently the only team who can kick off a \"redrive\" to fix this issue. I think creating a Resync Button would be a quick and easy way to always ensure that nothing went wrong before having to reach out to Conga Support. Since Conga Sign is only half native to Salesforce, there will always be issues where things do not line up all the way. This button would allow for much quicker fixes to records that may have just stumbled along the way to completion. This would also tremendously help the Conga Support team as a useful DIY tool for Admins to use before having to create a ticket for them.",

This customer creates layouts for their Sales reps so their sales reps do not have to manually add 5+ sign fields everytime. The original quote is created through another homegrown system and it's not possible to add Signing tags to the quotes prior to creation. Hence the layout option is being used.\n\u00a0\nThis one of many items that the customer should be able to edit on the web app. Let's make this thing self service!\n\u00a0\nCurrent Workarounds:\n1. To modify an existing layout through WEB UI - when you create a transaction and applies the existing layout. In the same page, you can modify the layout and then press save layout. When the option for Save Layout appears, you can search for the existing layout name and apply the changes which will overwrite the existing layout.\n\u00a0\n2. To delete a saved layout, you have two options:\n\u00a0\na) Download the tool available from our developers which will allow you to delete layouts under your accounts. It will require your login credentials for the tool to work successfully.\nb) It can be deleted via API: https://community.onespan.com/documentation/onespan-sign/guides/feature-guides/developer/managing-document-layouts",

GE would like to have a control on the date user can set for \"Transaction Expiration\".\n\n1. They have certain fields on Agreement object and they would like that system should not allow the user to enter an expiration date which is beyond the values in these fields ('Expiration date' and 'Validity date' are the 2 fields on Agreement object based on which GE would like to validate the Transaction Expiration).\n2. User should have flexibility to choose if the upper limit of the Transaction Expiration date is based on 'Expiration date' or 'Validity date' field on the agreement.\n3. User should have the flexibility to enforce this control on the transaction expiration date for each agreement. It should not be an org or business unit level setting.\n4. All dates should be in time zone of the logged in user.",

This can result in the incorrect version of the file being sent for signature when there is more than one version created on the same day that the most recent version was created.\n\nThe workaround is to either delete older file versions (unacceptable for our use case because we need to have history available), or to download the most recent file version and upload it back in as an entirely separate contentdocument and set that as primary (cumbersome workaround). We also can potentially catch this issue by previewing our file on the Conga Sign screen before sending, although users don't always do this or may not always see the version differences easily to catch the issue.\n\nWe are unfortunately going to have to create automation specifically to address this bug because it is not being fixed by Conga (or not in a timely fashion). The fact that Conga Sign will send out a version other than the most recent file version really reduces our faith in Conga Sign as a platform because certain version changes can be critical and these are documents going to our client or potential clients, therefore reducing our clients' faith in us if we accidentally send an older version of the file.\n\nIt should be relatively straightforward to order by ContentModifiedDate with the level of specificity necessary or IsLatest flag or utilize VersionNumber comparisons to identify the most recent version of a document.",

    "content": "Customer occasionally has the requirement for the same recipient to sign as multiple recipients in the same transaction. The recipients were being pulled dynamically, however when the recipient id is duplicated, that recipient only shows as 1 signer, although the same recipient may need to sign as multiple signers. for example signer 1 and signer 3. We have found a way to do this using CSFirst, CSlast, CSemail, however the recipient receives the email to sign multiple times, which they want to avoid as they have had records where the signer needs to sign as 5 more recipients. They would like to only receive the email once and have all signatures for each recipient (still same recipient id) be able to sign in same screen instead from multiple invitations to sign.\n\n\nrequested on case 00459124 by Hammerson Group Management (https://getconga.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/0015000000btj2rAAA/view)",

    "content": "I had a customer recently, Compass Furnished Apartments (see case here #00458780) where they were working on a lease agreement. Their leases will always have 4 signers, (1 - lessee, 2 - 2nd lessee (optional), 3 - cosigner (optional) and 4 - opp owner/lessor). When creating the document and going thru the merge process, they want all of the signers to have designated spots regardless of how many signers there are. Right now, if there's only signers 1 and 4, then 4 is prompted to sign in spots where signer 2 would sign.\n\n\nApparently Docusign has this feature already (but is lacking some that Conga Sign has). I think this would be a good feature for most of our customers, especially when the number of signers varies but some roles are permanent/required.",
