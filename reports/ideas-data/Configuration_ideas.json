Moreover, if a user changes value in second attribute i.e. \u2018Attribute2\u2019 then it should allow the manual change. However, if the value in first attribute i.e. \u2018Attribute1\u2019 is changed then the second attribute should be defaulted again based on its value.\n\u00a0\nWe are able to achieve the same partially using field expression and keeping its field \u2018Ismodified\u2019 to true. But, if we change first attribute again after changing second attribute manually then field expression does not defaults the second attribute.\n\u00a0\nPAR in this case can default the value in second attribute but only once as PAR will not be executed once the attribute changes. Moreover, we can\u2019t have field expression and PAR written on the same attribute parallelly.\n\u00a0\nSo Idea is to have Field expression priority precede over manual intervention, moreover allow manual changes too on the target attribute if primary attribute remains the same.",

They are currently using product groups as scope, but they want to move away from them due to the below reasons:\nThey have\u00a0many product groups and a large number of product group members in each group. These groups are already hitting higher limits of that supported in constraint rules. They have to onboard more users which will result in bigger product groups. This will definitely impact constraint rule performance.Product groups are hindering their turbo implementation as it is impacting data sync.Product groups require too much maintenance.\n\u00a0\nThe customer plans to use only criteria in constraint rule condition and action. They want that such rules should support all the existing functionality of Service CPQ constraint rules and this enhancement should also be supported by the Service CPQ constraint rule APIs.",

User is configuring both bundles with this option. he set constraint rule which checks if both bundles are from the same location or not. If both bundles have the same location then it throws a validation message to override the base price to 0 for the option 'D'. However, both bundles are from different locations but still they can see this validation.\n\u00a0\nAnalysis:\nWe have discussed this use case with our engineering team. We got confirmation that this scenario is not supported, and constraint rules with match-in locations won't be helpful in satisfying this new use case that user is trying to implement it.\n\u00a0\nAlso, 'Match in location' is only supported for some of the 'inclusion use' cases. It's not fully supported, for exclusion or validation.\nHence, this current use case will not be fulfilled by CR. However, there is another solution is you can write a validation callback to achieve this scenario.\n\u00a0\n-- User has requested enhancement for this issue.

The user selects sub bundles to attribute however it is expected that it cascades to its option but it does not happen the first time.

The reason behind this is (As per you mentioned) Whenever we select the option \"Custom Compliance Analytics Onboarding Services\" , we call the updateCartLineItems method. This inserts the Apttus_Config2__ProductAttributeValue__c object at the option and sub-option level. If the user selects the attribute before this call gets complete then the issue occurs.\n\nIf we change the code so that the attribute is cascaded before updateCartLineItems is called, then there will be a huge impact on the product and may result in lots of regression issues.\n\nThe user wants this to be considered as an enhancement for the future.",

Working - Non-working- Analysis in Customer Org: When user add a product named 'Cardio Black Pearl' and configure its attributes and other Options, few Options of 'Extras for Cardio' OptionGroup are auto-included as a part of inclusion rules. In Summer 20, those auto-included Options are not visible in right sidebar of bundle config page as shown in above screen-shot. But other options are visible.

I should be able provide multiple groups and criteria together. The split criteria will be always be based on the fields that are defined in \"Config System Properties\" custom setting. The split should always happen on the original bundle. This split should be supported by the Split API. Please find attached spreadsheet containing examples of the various scenarios.",

    "content": "The System is Admin is adding Attributes to an existing Product. Now there are old quotes in the system which have been finalized with the same Product having no Attributes. So when we created a new Configuration on the top of Finalized configuration the Product will not show any Attributes as the data is cloned from the finalised configuration. For attribute to show up,\"Has Attribute\" should remain checked on the Line Item and this doesn't happen when you create a new configuration which gets data from the old finalized one. It would be great if \"revalidate\" also updates the changes we make in Product Attributes.",

Auto Include Action Intent will only add the replacement product to the Cart, and not actually replace the original product.\n\n\nExpected Behavior: Whenever Action Intent is selected as Auto Include for CR action Replacement. Auto Include Action Intent will swap the product used in CR condition along auto inclusion of the desired product.\n\n\nThanks",

But the same is not working in the child Bundle. Customer is asking for the same functionality in Child Bundle as well. This would be helpful for the customers if provided.",

    "content": "Currently in Service CPQ functionality, we can either relate an equipment bundle asset with a service product, OR we can relate an equipment option component asset with the service product. As a result, when we associate the service product, the related line items are created only either for the bundle asset or the option component asset, but it cannot be created for both.\n\nFor Philips, the requirement is that some of options belonging to service bundle product can be selected only if a combination of a equipment bundle and equipment option is selected in the assets. Such a rule cannot be written currently in Apttus due to which their quoting requirements are not met.\n\nIs there some way possible to allow relating both equipment and options together with a service model?",

This leads to the user having to scroll through the list to get to the required one.",
